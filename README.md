# Unexpected Crash Using Third-Party Native Module in React Native

This repository demonstrates a bug in React Native where an unexpected crash occurs when using a third-party library that includes a native module. The crash is difficult to debug because the error message is not very informative.

## Bug Description
The application crashes unexpectedly when a specific function from the third-party library is called. The crash is intermittent and difficult to reproduce consistently.  The error log provides little information to pinpoint the source of the problem.

## Bug Solution
The solution involves carefully reviewing the native module's implementation and potentially using additional logging to help identify where the issue lies.  In some cases, the third-party library might need to be updated, or a more stable alternative may be necessary.
