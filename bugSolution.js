To solve this issue, follow these steps:
1. **Identify the Native Module:** Determine which native module is causing the crash. You can use the debugging tools in React Native and Xcode (or Android Studio) to examine the stack trace when the crash occurs.
2. **Add Logging:** Add more verbose logging to the native module itself to understand its behavior under various conditions.
3. **Review Native Module Code:** Examine the native module's code carefully for potential errors or edge cases that are not handled properly. Pay special attention to memory management and exception handling.
4. **Test Thoroughly:** After making any changes, thoroughly test the application to ensure the problem is resolved and no new issues are introduced.
5. **Update or Replace Library:** Consider updating the third-party library to a newer version. If the problem persists, you might need to search for an alternative library with a more stable and reliable native module.
